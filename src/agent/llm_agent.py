The LLM-powered DeFi intelligence agent is planned for a future release. 

**Why not now?** Public LLM APIs require payment for production use, making it infeasible for an open-source project to provide free access to all users.

**What's available now:**
- âœ… Wallet behavior analysis
- âœ… Token transfer pattern detection  
- âœ… Social sentiment analysis
- âœ… Machine learning fraud detection
- âœ… Risk scoring and categorization

**Future plans:**
- AI-powered explanations of DeFi concepts
- Natural language queries about wallets/tokens
- Automated risk assessment summaries
- On-chain analysis explanations

For now, explore the powerful fraud detection features in the other dashboard sections! ðŸš€"""
